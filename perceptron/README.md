Welcome to my humble notes about Neural Networks. I hope they work for you.

The basic unit of a neural network is a perceptron. A perceptron it's a "virtual neuron". All it does is to receive some inputs, apply some weights add those resuls to a bias.

Let's talk a little bit about real neurons.

Neurons "talk" to each other by sending electrical impulses. So they just to actions to communicate, say something or say nothing; 1 or 0. This is like an over-simplified version of what happens, but actually almost all we'll need about it. So a neuron receives 1's and 0's and depending on how many 1's and from which cell's are comming it sends a 1 or a 0 to the next neuron.
