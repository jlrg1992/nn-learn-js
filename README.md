# nn-learn-js
In this project I'll be adding what I learn about Neural Networks. The examples will be written in javascript, as it is a language available to everyone. Each topic will be in a different directory. And there will be a "library" directory where there will be the reusable code made on each topic. Have fun and happy coding!!!
